Cake Cake Leung Game
Overview:

Welcome to Cake-cake Leung, a captivating puzzle game designed to challenge your strategic thinking and quick decision-making skills. The objective of the game is to match emojis and create delightful combinations. Whether you prefer a relaxed experience or crave a time-bound challenge, Cake-cake Leung offers two modes to cater to your gaming style.

How to Play:
Run the 'main.py' file. Choose the size of your game board (ranging from 4x4 to 8x8) and select your preferred game mode: Classic or Time Attack. During gameplay, utilize the intuitive commands ('W', 'S', 'A', 'D') to move emojis and strategically form combinations. Should you want to exit the game, simply press 'q'.

Game Modes:
Classic Mode (c): Immerse yourself in the game at your own pace, with no time constraints. Take the time to strategize and create the most intricate combinations without the pressure of a ticking clock.
Time Attack Mode (t): Test your agility and speed with Time Attack mode. Choose from three time limits (1, 3, or 5 minutes) and see how many combinations you can make before the clock runs out.
Scoring System:
Earn points for your creativity and strategic moves:
â€¢	Butter (ðŸ§ˆ): 50 points
â€¢	Cake (ðŸŽ‚): 100 points
â€¢	Matching Cakes (horizontal): 500 points for each row of cakes

Example:
Picture this: you've chosen a 4x4 board size and opted for the classic game mode. As you employ 'W', 'S', 'A', and 'D' to navigate through the grid, your goal is to create harmonious combinations of emojis, earning points with each successful move. The simple yet engaging mechanics make Cake-cake Leung an enjoyable and addictive gaming experience.

Behind the scenes, Cake-cake Leung consists of two main files:
â€¢	main.py: This file handles user input, initializes the game, and provides a user-friendly interface.
â€¢	operations.py: Here, you'll find essential functions that drive the game mechanics, such as adding new emojis, managing movements, merging emojis, and calculating scores.
